## Useful information
ECRC code is being migrated to Github. All new and older code should be hosted in there. We have different GitHub Organizations that are meant to host and organize different types of code.

Our different GitHub Organizational structure is the following:

* [ECRC](https://github.com/ecrc)
        All software may be hosted here. 
* [ECRC PAPERS](https://github.com/ecrcpapers)
        Meant for papers. 
* [ECRC THESIS](https://github.com/ecrcthesis)
        Students thesis may be hosted here. 
* [ECRC PROPOSALS](https://github.com/ecrcproposals)
        Meant for Proposals 
* [ECRC PRESENTATIONS](https://github.com/ecrcpresentations)
        For Presentations 
* [ECRC POSTERS](https://github.com/ecrcposters)
        Meant for Posters 

Please ask to become a member or contributor.

## Naming convention
To help organize the different repos, we are proposing a naming convention as follows:

* ecrc: `projectname-dev (private and/or under development) / projectname (public)`
* ecrcpapers: `YYYY_venue_papercode`
* ecrcthesis: `YYYY_kaustlogin`
* ecrcpresentations: `YYYY_venue_presentationcode`
* ecrcproposals: `YYYY_proposalcode`
* ecrcposters: `YYYY_venue_postercode`

example: 2017_sc_mle

Remember to use **lowercase** and **unique** names/codes. Also please remember to use this for **ECRC related projects, not for personal projects**.
